# OneHacks II


OneHacks II is a completely free virtual hackathon, open to all high school students. No previous coding experience is required! Our main mission is to provide aspiring coders more opportunities for software and career development, so they can take their projects to the next level and lead to a more innovative future.



## Event Summary

This year, Onehacks II was a huge pleasure to organize and was very successful in terms of attendance, engagement, and the number of resources provided. We had over 300 signups leading to 53 project submissions. The attendees were able to listen to 4 speaker sessions by industry professionals, including the Founder and CEO of Codedex, Sonny Li, and the Founder and CEO of Echo3D, Alon Grinshpoon, about a variety of topics from career tips in tech to an introductory Python workshop. As a fun break from intense coding, we planned a raffle, Kahoot & bomb party sessions, and an MS Paint minigame hosted by Major League Hacking, which provided the over 30 participants with an exciting experience. Ultimately, we were able to provide all participants with participant gifts and 11 special awards to the best teams, adding up to around $60,000 in prizes and gifts.

We were able to feature GitHub’s support for our event in many different ways. We requested all participants to use GitHub to upload their project code for the judges to review. The GitHub logo was also used on our merchandise and prizes.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
Most of our signups in OneHacks were highschool students from all around the world, which we defined as being of ages 15-18. Although this was our intended demographics, we still received 28 university students registered from around the world, as well as 7 middle school students.
- Our Hackathon saw 349 signups in total
- 33 of our signups were female, while the other 310 signups were male. 6 of our signups identified themselves as neither female nor male.
- We did not ask participants what race they identify with, nor which continent they lived in.


## Impact of GitHub Grant

Most of the funding we received from GitHub largely went into our prizes, which was our main method of attracting students into competing in our event. By offering a large array of prizes, it encouraged our participants to pursue a more active role during our hackathon, which resulted in more community-changing ideas and innovation. A portion of our funding also went into creating T-shirts and printing stickers. These merchandises not only helped advertise GitHub and other sponsors, but also gave our participants an active reminder of their experiences with OneHacks, leaving with them valuable memories to have in the future.

## What’s Next?

Overall, our event attracted far more people than we initially expected, with students from all across the globe coming together to innovate. Despite a few hiccups on the first and second days, with our opening videos coming out a bit late, it ultimately went as smoothly as we can ask for. 

Most of our OneHacks team this year will be graduating next year, so as of right now there are no solid plans on a OneHacks 3/2023. However, hopefully our younger team members will be able to carry the torch forward.
